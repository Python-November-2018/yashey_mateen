deactivate (This will deactivate your virtual environment)

pip3 list 
--This is different because the virtual environment contained its own separate packages (including Django)
but when deactivated, shows the virtual environment itself and the packages installed in the main system

pip install Django==1.11.9 
--Output shows that "Requirement already satisfied, which means that this command has already been executed and thus Django is already installed

pip freeze 
--freeze shows all the packages installed within the local virtual environment and produces a text file specifying each package version


pip freeze > requirements.txt
--When this command is run after navigating to Desktop directory, and you run ls command to list all the files, it shows the requirements text file
produced in the Desktop. Within this file is the package and version # of the packages installed in the local virtual environment
 

pip uninstall Django

pip show Django
